# IBM-Data-Analyst-Professional-Certificate
IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project
  I am a mechanical engineer transitioning into the data science industry. This project is my analysis of data from GitHub Job Openings, Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey, and a web scraped table generated by IBM. This course took 142 hours and is my second data analyst certificate. In total, I have spent 252 hours learning about data analysis from zero at the time of this post (2-7-22). My linkedin is below if you would like to connect or send me a message about your thoughts on my work or anything that might be helpful to achieve my goal. I'm an eager learner and always ready to acquire more useful skills/data.
